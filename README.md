# Bird Flap Game 

A classic **Flappy Bird-style game** made with **Python** and **Turtle Graphics**, using object-oriented programming and sprite assets. The player controls a bird that flaps through randomly generated pipes, avoiding obstacles and trying to achieve the highest possible score.

Built during my second year of university as an object-oriented Python exercise with visual and interactive gameplay.

---

##  Gameplay Overview

- The bird is affected by **gravity**, and you must **flap** (via `SPACE` or `LEFT CLICK`) to keep it airborne.
- Pipes are generated at intervals with randomized gaps that the bird must fly through.
- The background randomly switches between different sky themes on each run.
- Your **score increases over time** as you survive. A **high score** is saved between sessions.
- You can restart the game at any time after failing.
